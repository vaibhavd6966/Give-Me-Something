            <p>
              To the one who makes my world brighter with every smile, 
              who turns ordinary moments into extraordinary memories, 
              and whose love makes every day feel like a celebration. 
              On your special day, I want you to know that you're not 
              just my girlfriend, but my best friend, my confidante, 
              and my greatest blessing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your presence in my life has brought colors I never knew 
              existed, joy I never thought possible, and love that grows 
              deeper with each passing day. You deserve all the happiness 
              in the world, and I promise to spend every day trying to 
              give you just that.

            <p>Do you remember our first birthday together? Celebrating you felt magical, and sharing laughs with Siddhi made it even more special (you still owe me a party! üòâ). That day, I realized how much I love seeing you happy your smile, your laughter, your sparkle. Your birthday became just as important to me as mine. You are my world, my happiness, my love forever, and I can't wait for many more. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®</p>
